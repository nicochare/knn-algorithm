# KNN Diabetes Prediction Algorithm

This project was done by **NicolÃ¡s Chareca**, **Pablo Carro**, **Jianliang Chen** and **AdriÃ¡n Baquedano**.

This was a part of the subject Algorithms in the [Computer Science Major](https://www.unavarra.es/en/sites/grados/informatica-y-telecomunicacion/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion.html) in the [Public University of Navarre](https://www.unavarra.es/home), in which we were prompted to program the KNN Algorithm to predict a topic of our choice.

The bot uses the [KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbors]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)) algorithm to find the closest K examples that matches the prompted subject.

We were graded as one of the best projects that were presented in this class with a 9.4 out of 10 for the whole team.

This was the given task list to complete this project:

```
1. Data entry of the problem dataset.
2. Normalization of the values of the numerical attributes of the dataset.
3. Creation of the data structure.
4. Classification of a new example set using K-NN for K=1.
5. Classification of a set of examples for K=1. 6.
6. Classification of a new example using K-NN for K=k.
7. Classification of a set of examples for K=k.
8. Preprocessing of the dataset using Wilson's Algorithm (ENN).
9. Evolution of the hit accuracy as a function of the number of examples and the value of K.
```
